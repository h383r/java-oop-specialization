QUIZ, Add your own extension!

Ideas for extending the functionality of the earthquake application:
- When clicking on a city, display a popup menu either on or off the map (off will be easier)
  which displays a count for the number of nearby earthquakes (within threatCircle) the average
  magnitude, and most recent earthquake. Get creative with the data you want to display.
x Style your earthquake or city markers to make them more aesthetically pleasing.
  You could use an image for the marker, or play around with PGraphics and PApplet drawing 
  methods to make them how you want.
- Ensure that the popup info boxes about the earthquakes and cities are always drawn on top of
  the other graphical information (markers). There are some links that will be helpful with 
  this in the module 5 programming assignment.
- Support clicking on markers which are still displayed while another is clicked rather than 
  always resetting on the second click.
- Use keyboard events to change which earthquakes are displayed by age or only display cities
  which are above a certain latitude. etc.

Ideas for incorporating new data sources:
  These extensions will be a little more difficult than just working within the earthquake application
  because you will have to work with new data and understand how it is represented. Depending on 
  what you want to do, you might even write your own data parsing functions, or modify ours.
  However, even though these extensions are challenging, we think they will be a lot of fun.

  - New data source idea 1: Work with the airport and route data
  - New data source idea 2: Work with data from the World Bank
 
MY EXTENSIONS:

My Submision
- Project Title: UCSDUnfoldingMaps module 6
- Please upload your screenshot as a png or jpg format file (step 1 from the assignment instructions).
- In 3-6 sentences of plain English, describe what functionality your program includes over the basic requirements of the project through module 6 (step 2 from the assignment instructions). 

Aditions/modifications made for step 5 from the assignment instructions:

* Changed the map provider from Google to ESRI. new EsriProvider.NatGeoWorldMap();

* Changed the size of the map inside the canvas and position of Key to improve visibility.

* Changed the style of earthquake and city markers to make them more aesthetically pleasing.

* Centered the map and configured the initial zoom with map.zoomAndPanTo.
   
* Changed the city triangle icon in Key into a button that hide/show all the cities in the map wen is clicked to improve visibility of earthquakes.
---------------------------------------------

In 1-3 paragraphs (3-5 sentences each) or a bulleted list 
(1-3 sentences per bullet) describe the additions/modifications 
you made to the code to support your extension 
(step 3 from the assignment instructions).

Additions/modifications made in step 3 from the assignment instructions.
 
In the step 3 from the assignment instructions we have implemented the Comparable interface in EarthquakeMerker making the next additions/modifications:
 
* Added the keyword implements Comparable<EarthquakeMarker> in the class EarthquakeMarker to implement an interface. 
* Implemented the compareTo method in the EarthquakeMarker class so that it sorts earthquakes in reverse order of magnitude.

In the step 4 we have implemented the private method sortAndPrint that print out all of the earthquakes, we called this method from setUp().

In the step 5 we have added our own extension, detailed before.
