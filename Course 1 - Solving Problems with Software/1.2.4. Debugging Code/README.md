# Debugging Excercise

Write a method that finds each occurrence of “abc_” in a String input (where _ is a single character) and prints “bc_” for each such occurrence. For example, findAbc(“abcdefabcghi”) should print:

    bcd
    bcg


Test method findAbc() by adding a line in the test() method:

    findAbc("abcd");
